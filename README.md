ðŸ“Š Call Center Performance Dashboard

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This Excel dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of call center operations, helping monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. Using real-world data, it visualizes trends related to representative performance, call duration, customer satisfaction, and the number of calls handled.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about call center interactions, including:

â€¢	Call Number â€“ A unique identifier for each call.

â€¢	Customer ID â€“ A unique identifier for each customer.

â€¢	Call Duration â€“ The total time spent on each call (in seconds).

â€¢	Representative â€“ The agent handling the call.

â€¢	Date of Call â€“ When the call took place.

â€¢	Purchase Amount â€“ The amount spent by the customer (if applicable).

â€¢	Satisfaction Rating â€“ Customer feedback on a scale of 1 to 5.

â€¢	Fiscal Year (FY) â€“ The year in which the call was recorded.

â€¢	Day of the Week â€“ The weekday when the call occurred.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Insights & KPI Questions

The dashboard provides answers to key performance questions such as:

ðŸ”¹ Representative Performance

     â€¢How many calls did Representative 1 (R01) attend?

     â€¢What was the average duration of calls for each representative?

     â€¢How does each representativeâ€™s total handling time compare to others?
     
ðŸ”¹ Call Duration Analysis

     â€¢What is the average call duration across all representatives?

     â€¢Which representative has the longest/shortest call duration?

     â€¢How does call duration vary by day of the week?

ðŸ”¹ Customer Satisfaction

     â€¢How many 5-star ratings did each representative receive?

     â€¢What is the overall satisfaction score per representative?

     â€¢Which representative has the highest/lowest customer satisfaction?

ðŸ”¹ Call Volume Trends

     â€¢How many calls were handled daily/weekly/monthly?

     â€¢What are the peak call times?

     â€¢Which day had the highest and lowest number of calls?

ðŸ”¹ Revenue Impact

      â€¢How much total revenue (purchase amount) is linked to each representativeâ€™s calls?

      â€¢Is there a correlation between satisfaction rating and purchase amount?

      â€¢Do longer call durations impact customer spending?



ðŸ”§ Tools Used

â€¢	Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting)

â€¢	Data Cleaning & Transformation (Excel functions for structuring data)

â€¢	Visualizations (Bar charts, line graphs, and interactive elements for analysis)


ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project serves as a valuable tool for call center managers and analysts to monitor agent efficiency, improve service quality, and make data-driven decisions. The insights gained can help optimize call center operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

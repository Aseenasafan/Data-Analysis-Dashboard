ðŸ“Š Call Center Performance Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This Excel dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of call center operations, helping monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. Using real-world data, it visualizes trends related to representative performance, call duration, customer satisfaction, and the number of calls handled.
ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about call center interactions, including:
â€¢	Call Number â€“ A unique identifier for each call.
â€¢	Customer ID â€“ A unique identifier for each customer.
â€¢	Call Duration â€“ The total time spent on each call (in seconds).
â€¢	Representative â€“ The agent handling the call.
â€¢	Date of Call â€“ When the call took place.
â€¢	Purchase Amount â€“ The amount spent by the customer (if applicable).
â€¢	Satisfaction Rating â€“ Customer feedback on a scale of 1 to 5.
â€¢	Fiscal Year (FY) â€“ The year in which the call was recorded.
â€¢	Day of the Week â€“ The weekday when the call occurred.
ðŸ“Š Dashboard Insights
The dashboard provides the following key insights:
â€¢	Representative Performance â€“ Tracks the number of calls attended by each representative and their average call duration.
â€¢	Call Duration Analysis â€“ Highlights trends in call lengths to identify efficiency improvements.
â€¢	Customer Satisfaction â€“ Analyzes satisfaction ratings per representative and call category.
â€¢	Call Volume Trends â€“ Displays daily call counts to identify peak hours and workload distribution.
â€¢	Revenue Impact â€“ Shows purchase amounts linked to customer interactions.
ðŸ”§ Tools Used
â€¢	Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting)
â€¢	Data Cleaning & Transformation (Excel functions for structuring data)
â€¢	Visualizations (Bar charts, line graphs, and interactive elements for analysis)
ðŸ“¥ How to Use
1.	Open the Excel file containing the dataset and dashboard.
2.	Explore the interactive charts to analyze key metrics.
3.	Use filters to drill down into specific representatives, dates, or performance trends.
ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project serves as a valuable tool for call center managers and analysts to monitor agent efficiency, improve service quality, and make data-driven decisions. The insights gained can help optimize call center operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
